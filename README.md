This model predicts the punctuation of English, Italian, French and German texts. We developed it to restore the punctuation of transcribed spoken language. 

This multilanguage model was trained on the [Europarl Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wmt/europarl) provided by the [SEPP-NLG Shared Task](https://sites.google.com/view/sentence-segmentation). *Please note that this dataset consists of political speeches. Therefore the model might perform differently on texts from other domains.*

The model restores the following punctuation markers: **"." "," "?" "-" ":"**

## Results 

The model achieves the following F1 scores for the different languages. The performance differs for the single punctuation markers. Hyphens and colons, in many cases, are optional and can be substituted by either a comma or a full stop.
